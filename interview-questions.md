# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is version control software that allows work to be performed on isolated instances of files without risking alteration of the source. Once changes are deemed satisfactory those changes can be applied to the source. GitHub is website that stores remote copies of source data as well as instances of that source so that multiple users can access this data and work collaboratively.

Researched answer: Git is a version control system that is accessed through command-line and does not require an internet connection. GitHub is a web-based platform, with GUI that hosts Git repositories and provides project management tools


2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: The value of an array is everything stored in the array and the index is the location of the values stored in the array.

Researched answer: Array indexes represent the elements of an array. It is the elements that contain the values. The value is the actual data stored in the element.

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays are collections of data that can be any primitatve data type. Strings are a primitive data type. Strings and arrays both have length properties and indexes.

Researched answer: Arrays and strings are both objects with lengths and indexes, but are represented differently ([] vs ""); Contain different types of data (arrays can contain various data types and strings contain only characters which are themselves strings); Arrays can be altered by mutators but strings cannot.

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: Encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher Order Functions: Functions that take functions as inputs or provide functions as outputs.

2. Jest: A JavaScript testing framework.

3. Objects: A data type containing key-value pairs.
